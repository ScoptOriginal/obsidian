To implement a day/night cycle using Construct, you can follow these general steps:

1. Create a Global Variable: Start by creating a global variable to track the time of day. For example, you can use a variable called "timeOfDay" and set its initial value to represent the starting time of your day/night cycle.

2. Set Time Progression: Determine how the time will progress in your game. You can use a timer or a frame counter to increment the "timeOfDay" variable gradually over time.

3. Update Visuals: Based on the current value of the "timeOfDay" variable, update the visuals of your game to reflect the appropriate lighting and environmental changes. For example, during daytime, you can make the environment brighter and display a clear sky, while during nighttime, you can dim the lighting and add stars or a moon.

4. Adjust Gameplay Mechanics: Consider how the day/night cycle affects gameplay mechanics. For instance, certain events or interactions might only be available during specific times of day. You can use conditional statements to check the value of the "timeOfDay" variable and trigger corresponding gameplay changes.

5. Transition Effects: To create smooth transitions between day and night, you can use fade-in and fade-out effects to gradually change the lighting and visuals. You can accomplish this by adjusting the opacity or color of relevant objects or using transition effects provided by Construct.

6. Repeat Cycle: Once the "timeOfDay" variable reaches the end of your desired day/night cycle, reset it back to the starting value and repeat the cycle to create a continuous day/night progression.

Remember to test and iterate on your implementation to ensure that the day/night cycle feels smooth and visually appealing in your game.
