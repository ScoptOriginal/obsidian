  Overall story
- the player is an ancient vampire who has sworn to resurrect their old friend
- travel through an idyllic kingdom into a cursed land
- stop at the major churches to collect the pieces of your friend
- end at a derelict crypt and choose whether to uphold your oath or forever prevent the Great Evil from returning
- bonus ending for not drinking blood, having a 'good' playthrough and sealing the Great Evil
  
  Mechanical principles:
  
  Stealth
- enemies are on a patrol pattern
- player is faster than enemies
- plenty of safe hiding spots
- sneak attack bonus
  
  Feeding, blood meter and rage
- instead of sneak attack, players can choose to feed
- feeding increases blood meter
- players can feed in combat
- higher blood meter increases damage and health
- when blood meter is full, player goes into Rage Mode
- Rage Mode turns every hit into a crit
  
  Crits
- Each hit has a base 10% chance to crit
- crits deal an extra base 25% damage
- crit chance and crit damage can be improved
  
  Skills and abilities
- player can level up by killing enemies, completing quests, discovering locations and drinking blood
- levelling up gives 1 [[Evolve]] point (or 2 if no blood has been consumed)
- stronger skills and abilities crit more
- many improve crits
- some magic, some vampiric abilities
  
  Party System
- players can recruit clerics and other vampires, as well as some other unusual allies
- all party members level up along with the player character
- party members greatly affect the style of combat
  
  Turn-based combat
- basic attacks are always highly effective
- vampiric abilities also remain effective and have other positive effects but cannot be used as often
- magic skills are extremely powerful, but get outscaled and are expensive to use
  
  Morality
- throughout the game, the player will be asked to make choices
- some of these choices will sway their alignment towards either 'good' or 'evil'
- player alignment is not shown to them but influences shop prices, enemy strength and story direction
